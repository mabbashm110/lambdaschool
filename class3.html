    NOTES:
    1. Specificity read more in terms of weight - UI 1 https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/
    2. CSS is cascading! top to bottom.
    3. Inline style overrides CSS eg: <div style=
    4. !important overrides everything in CSS for that style
    5. CSS Reset


    Display types
    1. Span same line
    2. p new line
    3. block will take the entire width eg
    4. Learn display property css to understand.. 
    5. display: none; will make it totally invisible on the screen, does not take space on screen
    6. visibility: hidden; will make it hidden but take space on screen
    7. display: inline - makes it inline without line breaks.
    8. display: inline-block - divs next to each other.
    9. box-sizing: border-box; will be set to width and height, shrinks content
    10. margin, padding, border - have 4 properties (top right bottom left) clockwise in order mentioned - TRBL, if 2, (topbottom, leftright)
    11. CSS box model - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
    12. Automatic css center horizontally margin: 20px auto; NOTE: No top and bottom auto, because it is a block and browser does not have a concept. Also auto wont work on divs in inline-block;
    13. For inline-block auto will not work! even if it is a single div
    14. For 12/13 use flex box!
    15. Make a border a circle -eg: border-radius: 50px; or border-radius: 50%;
    16. Four positions in css.  with the position property - position: static; then use top left bottom right in conjunction.
        Static: every element is default to static, until we change position property!
        Relative: element should be static, but gives us cool things to use: use top, left, bottom, right properties: eg: top: 100px, moves 100px away from the edge of the screen/html body 
            or item that is relative in case of a child element;
        Fixed: Position is fixed to display window, even if you have another paragraph so long, it will stay fixed on screen display, even if it is a child element.
        Absolute: relative is one step up (positioning wise), absolute is up the ancestral chain, relative to top most
    17. Z-index: is like the layers on page - if you have a multiple divs on the page you can put it as top and bottom, like layers in Fireworks and Photoshop. Remember the elements have to 
        be on the same level. You can put the child behind the parent if the posiiton is absolute or fixed. So ideally top to bottom. To make it completely bottom use z-index: -1; 
        One other note: Index is assigned based on the order, so first div will be 1, second below it will be 2.
