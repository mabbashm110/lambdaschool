<!-- Notes: read flexbox
1. li*3 will do this
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
2. URL: Emmet shortcuts
3. Important: Always start with basics, do not get complicated, do the colors so that you know what is going on.
4. It is required to put display: flex in child items even after a parent has it because they are parent items for a child... It applies to the only element you put it on
5. Flex direction row is default
6. 100vh will distribute the page across the browser.
